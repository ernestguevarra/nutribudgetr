# nutribudget: An Implementation of SPRING’s Nutrition Budget Analysis Tool in R

Despite recognition that creating and sustaining financial support for
nutrition is critical, nutrition advocates lack access to accurate and
timely financial data. In response to this challenge, the
[USAID](https://www.usaid.gov/)-funded [Strengthening Partnerships,
Results, and Innovations in Nutrition Globally
(SPRING)](https://www.spring-nutrition.org/) project has developed a
tool that will help nutrition stakeholders learn where the funding is,
understand existing resource gaps, and advocate for adequate budgets.
This package is an implementation of
[SPRING](https://www.spring-nutrition.org/)’s budget analysis tool in R.
