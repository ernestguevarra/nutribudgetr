Description: Despite recognition that creating and sustaining financial support 
    for nutrition is critical, nutrition advocates lack access to accurate and 
    timely financial data. In response to this challenge, the USAID-funded 
    Strengthening Partnerships, Results, and Innovations in Nutrition Globally 
    (SPRING) project has developed a tool that will help nutrition stakeholders 
    learn where the funding is, understand existing resource gaps, and advocate 
    for adequate budgets. This package is an implementation of SPRING's budget 
    analysis tool in R.
